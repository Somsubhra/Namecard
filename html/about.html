<h1>About</h1><hr />
<p>'I code therefore I am', and so, this is Somsubhra Bairi and welcome to my web kingdom. I am a software developer and hacker and my passions include contributing to free and open source software development.</p>
<p>Currently, I am an undergraduate student at <a href="http://www.daiict.ac.in">DA-IICT</a>, Gandhinagar. I did my schooling in Ahmedabad, Gujarat. Though I am a Bengali by origin, I can say that I am more of a Gujarati as I have spent all my life in the vibrant and charming city of Ahmedabad.</p>
<p>What I love? Coding, computers, open source, anything to do with software. I have interests in fields of artificial intelligence, robotics, software security and high performance computing. Other interests include painting (though it has been years since I held a brush!), cartoons (yes, I still watch cartoons!) and reading lots of fiction.</p>
